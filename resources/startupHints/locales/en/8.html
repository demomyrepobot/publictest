		In OpenBoard, you can have access to images in several ways.
		<h3>Organize your Pictures folder</h3>
		<p>Screen captures added to the Library are saved to the Pictures folder : <span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/PicturesCategory.png" alt=""></span><br>You can create folders using <span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/miniNewFolder.png" alt=""></span> at the bottom of the Library. Then, drag and drop your images in the different folders you created.</p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint8/image-gif1.gif" alt=""></div>
		
		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>No matter where you are in the OpenBoard Library, images you add will be automatically placed inside the Pictures folder, to keep things organized.</span>

		<h3>Add images from your computer</h3>
		<p>You can also add images directly from your computer, like illustrated below :</p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint8/image-gif3.gif" alt=""></div>

		<h3>Add images from the search engines</h3>
		<p>Last but not least, you can search and add to your board royalty free images, using the search engines located in the Web Search folder : <span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/PicturesCategory.png" alt=""></span></p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint8/image-gif2.gif" alt=""></div>

		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>Instead of using drag and drop, just click on one of the images returned by your search, to see details about the image, and find an option to add it to the Library, without adding it to your current document. Useful when preparing a lesson !</span>
