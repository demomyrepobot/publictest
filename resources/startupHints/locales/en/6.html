		The Web Mode is an internal navigator that adds some cool features to a more standard one.
		<h3>Use the internal navigator</h3>
		<p>Using the internal navigator, you'll be able to browse the Internet without the need for reducing or exiting OpenBoard, with some additional features giving the ability to capture part of the screen or create applications from sites, and add them to the whiteboard !</p>

		<h3>Create an application</h3>
		<p>You can create an application from any site, in order to add it to the board and interact with it like with default applications.</p>
		<p>To do so, go to the website you want to capture, click on <span class="icon"><img src="assets/hint6/addToolToLibrary.png" alt="Capture Web Content"></span> and confirm the creation by clicking on "Create an application".</p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint6/app-gif2.gif" alt=""></div>

		<p>When an application is created, it is automatically saved in the OpenBoard library, so you can use it in any document. You'll find them on the applications folder, under a dedicated one called "Web".</p>

		<h3>Use an external navigator</h3>
		<p>You can also choose to use an external navigator, by checking the corresponding option in the preferences. Clicking on the Web icon will then launch your favorite navigator in Desktop Mode.</p>
		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>Using an external navigator, you will still be able to create applications from a site, by copying the URL in the address bar of your navigator, coming back to Board, and pasting it !</span>
